        <ol style="font-family:verdana;">
            <li>My name is Fiona. I am double majoring in 
                Communication Design and Art History. I am currently
                a junior undergraduate.</li>
            <li>I grew up in Chicago with a younger sister and my 
                two parents. I'm taking this class because I'd like to have
                a better grasp on how to apply design to the digital realm.</li>
            <li>The last time I had any hands-on experience with coding was in my
                8th grade Introduction to Computer Science course, so I'll admit I
                am a bit rusty when it comes to HTML and CSS. However, quite a bit
                about coding has been coming back to me since working on this assignment
                and the "Hello World" assignment.</li>
            <li>In this class, I hope to learn how well-designed websites are coded
                using HTML/CSS, and to apply such strategies to my own digital design work.</li>
            <li>I expect that designing for the screen will be less intuitive than
                designing on paper. Unlike analog design, screen-based design requires
                a whole new language that must be understood in order to display specific
                design choices. For this reason I imagine I may get a bit frustrated in
                the translation process from design idea to coding the idea to its manifestation
                on screen.</li>
            <li>I believe a good example of effective web design is 
                <a href=https://are.na>Are.na</a>. It is minimalistic, easy to navigate, and centers
                viewers' attention on posts rather than potentially distracting web 
                design elements.</li>
            <li>I think a good example of a website with effective communication
                is <a href=https://amazon.com>Amazon</a>. Information is displayed in hierarchies
                from most to least important. Product categories are separated into like
                areas on screen. I feel as though I know what Amazon wants me to look at
                first, second, and third.</li>
            <li>I think <a href=https://chase.com>Chase Bank's website</a> is an example of a 
                website that works well. It is secure, organized, and prioritizes privacy.
                It also runs both quickly and smoothly.</li>
        </ol>
